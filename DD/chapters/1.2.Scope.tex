As described in the RASD document, the Data4Help is made pf four distinct components: three clients (Data4Help Smartwatch App, Data4Help Mobile App, the Website) and a server application (Data4Help Core).

In this document, we will discuss the several layer of the system and how the multiple parts interacts one with the other. 
The users, who are divided into Companies and individuals, can subscribe to the service and take advantage of the functionalities offered.
The system is in charge to verify that the data received will be stored in the database consistently.
The system is build as Multi-tier, divided in Client, Business Logic, and Data. External interfaces must be implemented in the business logic, in order to exploit external services APIs.

During the whole document, we will make several cross-reference to the RASD document, in order to maintain a certain degree of coherence and consistency, as the DD document is an extension of the RASD.
