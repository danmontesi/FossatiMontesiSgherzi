\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data4Help SmartWatch App}: Development will focus on the production of a WatchOS and a WearOS app in order to properly communicate with their respective smartphone app.\newline As an app built for the latest version of those OSes is also backwords compatible with their previous versions, there are no particular \textit{minimum version} requirements.
    \item \textbf{Data4Help Mobile App}: Due to the fact that iOS and Android are the only OSes that provide a seamless integration with their smartwatch counterparts, the app will be developed for those platforms.
    In order to support smartwatch communication there is a minimum version required for those OSes, namely:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Android \textgreater \vspace{0.1cm} 4.4
        \item iOS \textgreater \vspace{0.4cm} 9.3
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
