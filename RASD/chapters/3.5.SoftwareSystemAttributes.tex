\subsubsection{Reliability}
The system should be reliable in 99\% of the cases. Downtime is prevented since expected and unexpected maintenance proceeding and upgrades do not interfere with the normal activity of the service.
High usage of redundancy and process resilience is expected to be used by the components of the system in order to guarantee a low failure rate.

\subsubsection{Availability}
In order to guarantee  high reliability, the system is expected to offer an ideal 24/7 service. A 3-nine availability service is expected (8.76 hours/year downtime)

\subsubsection{Security}
All —Ålients' requests must be encrypted using a public-private key mechanism.
User credentials are stored in DBMS, their password is secured and encrypted by hash functions.
Data of user health parameters are stored in DBMS as well.
The payment security for the company subscription plan is guaranteed by third-party services. 
\subsubsection{Maintainability}
Maintenance is expected not to interfere with normal use of the applications. In order to guarantee that, all the components of the system are modular, decoupled between each other, and hierarchically organized.
\subsubsection{Portability}
Mobile application is developed to be used only in smartphones.

Smartwatch app also is developed to be used only in smartwatch and similar wearable devices.

Web services used by companies and running events organizers could be developed as a mobile app in order to increase portability, but it will reduce usability of the software.
