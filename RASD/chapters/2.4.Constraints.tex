\subsubsection{Regulatory policies}
As Data4Help will handle sensitive user data (e.g. name, birth date, location, state of health) the Application must treat them respecting the local laws, in particular the GDPR European law. Data attributable to the user must be anonymized in order to appear in a Company's search, unless the user has given explicit authorization to that company.

\subsubsection{Security consideration}
All data transferred between Data4Help Mobile App and Data4Help Core must be encrypted in order to minimize the possibility of a man-in-the-middle attack or any unauthorized access.
For the same reason, all communication between Data4Help Web site and Data4Help Core must be encrypted.
The Bluetooth communication between Data4Help SmartWatch App and Data4Help Mobile app is already encrypted by the Bluetooth stack itself.
