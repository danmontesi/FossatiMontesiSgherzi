Then he starts to query on the city, inserting:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Age of the people to search (i.e. from 20 to 25 year old)
    \item The hour when to search people (i.e. from 9.00 to 10.00)
    \item The health parameter filters (i.e. heart rate $<$ 100 bpm, pressure $>$ 130 mmHg)
\end{itemize}
 The Data4Help system firstly checks if the query is satisfiable (i.e. is too specific), if yes, it shows a map with most frequent places of Milan where people go, with average of every health parameter registered from their users.
