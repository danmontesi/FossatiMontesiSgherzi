In the system there are 2 types of communication.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The Mobile App and the Web Site need a bidirectional channel with the Core component of the system to operate properly. \\
    This can be achived by providing a REST API on the \textit{Data4Help Core} component.
    
    \item The Smartwatch App needs a direct connection with the Mobile app to give it user's data.\\ The communication between the smart device and the smartphone is achieved via \textit{BLE} and, once the channel is established, the Smartwatch App sends JSON messages to the Mobile App concerning all activities performend from the last syncronization.

\end{enumerate}
