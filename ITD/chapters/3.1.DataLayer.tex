In order to manage data for our system, according to  DD document, we needed a relational database.
We could choose any SQL database. 
We opted for \texttt{PostgreSQL} because of its:
\begin{itemize}
    \item stability;
    \item high scalability;
    \item being opensource;
    \item easy to set up and use;
    \item availability of libraries for many programming languages;
    \item possibility to obtain free instance on Heroku;
\end{itemize}
