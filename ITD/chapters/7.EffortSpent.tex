    During the initial part of the work we spent the great majority of time planning the initial scheduling of our tasks, in order to work as independently as possible during the later part of the project.\\
    
    \noindent The first week of work was spent mainly on deciding which requirements to implement, dividing the tasks needed for the completion of the project, the technologies and frameworks to use; additionally we defined a mockup for the REST API.\\
    
    \noindent After that we started each branch of the project separately, using the mockup defined together as guideline, although meeting periodically to keep each other update about the progress.\\
    
    \noindent Finally we met to integrate the services and test every requirement with their action flow as defined in RASD and DD documents.\\
    
    \noindent Specificaly, the team members focused on:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Nicola Fossati}: Flutter mobile app development and testing, design of the app user interface and experience, integration with Google Maps, integration testing with backend and initial database construction;
        \item \textbf{Daniele Montesi}: web app and initial database construction, integration and web user experience study;
        \item \textbf{Francesco Sgherzi}: mocking platform, backend design, development and testing, integration with email service, featuring testing and database construction and management.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \noindent Each member of the team spend around 110/120 hours on the project for both the IDT and the development.
