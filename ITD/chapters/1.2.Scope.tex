As described in the RASD document and in the DD document, the Data4Help service is made of four distinct components: three clients (Data4Help Smartwatch App, Data4Help Mobile App, Website) and a server application (Data4Help Core). \\
\noindent The users, who are divided into Companies, Individuals and Run organizers, can subscribe to the service and take advantage of the functionalities offered.\\

\noindent Data4Help App aims at providing a intuitive user interface that allows users to see their health data, coming from smart devices such as Smart-watches, and participate to a Run organized by Data4Help. Data4Help website aims giving to Third parties(i.e. the companies) a portal to access to the system functionalities such as query on user's data. \\

\noindent During the whole document, we will make several cross-references to the RASD and DD documents , in order to maintain a certain degree of coherence and consistency.
